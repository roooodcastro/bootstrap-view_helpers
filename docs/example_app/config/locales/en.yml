        Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the
        handful of available and flexible alert messages.
      description_html: >
        Alerts are available for any lenght of text, and also for rendering
        content with blocks. Bootstrap <b>requires</b> a contextual style to be
        applied to each alert. To make this gem more flexible, a default alert
        style is applied if this option is not specified. The default style if
        <code>secondary</code>.
      examples: Examples
      basic_usage: Basic Usage
      basic_usage_html: >
        The most basic way to create an alert using Bootstrap View Helpers is
        shown below, with the method <code>bs_alert</code>. <br>An alert can
        be created without any arguments, but it will only render an empty
        alert. The first parameter of the method is the text to be displayed
        inside the alert.
      styles: Contextual Styles
      styles_html: >
        To add a different contextual style to the alert, use the second
        parameter, which is a options hash. The key <code>:style</code>
        specifies which contextual style should be used. If <code>:style</code>
        if set to a style that's not valid (ie. not one of the eight default
        Bootstrap contextual styles), a <code>StyleNotFoundError</code>
        error will be thrown.
      block_passing: Block Passing
      block_passing_html: >
        Instead of using the first argument to set the alert text, a block can
        be passed and the first argument omitted. This way, it's possible to
        make much more complex alert messages, and also render other Bootstrap
        components inside it.
      dismissible: Dismissing
      dismissible_html: >
        Any alert can include a button to allow the user to remove it from the
        page. To do this, first make sure Bootstrap's alert JavaScript plugin
        is configured,
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/#dismissing">
        following these steps</a>.<br/>Then, simply set the
        <code>:dismissible</code> key to <code>true</code> in the options hash.
        This will make the alert vanish with a fade animation. To remove this
        animation, set the <code>:fade</code> key, which is true by default,
        to <code>false</code>.
